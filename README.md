# TensorFlow Object Model

This project utilizes TensorFlow models for object detection, hand gesture recognition, and face mesh detection.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have the following packages installed:

- @tensorflow-models/coco-ssd@^2.2.2
- @tensorflow/tfjs@^2.4.0
- @stripe/react-stripe-js
- @tensorflow-models/handpose
- @tensorflow-models/facemesh
- fingerpose
- react-webcam

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install

Usage
To start the application, run the following command:
npm start
```

This will launch the app and display the different components.

## Tensorflow_Model

This component utilizes TensorFlow models to detect objects in images displayed on the screen.

## GestureRecognition

The GestureRecognition component captures handshapes and recognizes predefined gestures such as "Thumbs Up" and "Victory" sign.

## FacemashDetection

The FacemashDetection component captures the face and creates a 2D triangulation according to the face, similar to Snapchat filters.
